###Overview of the Data
The main dataset used in this analysis consists of 550,755 citations handed out in Houston, Texas over the course of the period from 7/1/12 to 3/31/15. It was sourced from the [Houston Data Portal](http://data.houstontx.gov/dataset/city-of-houston-parking-citations) on 5/7/16. Additional datasets included in this analysis are as follows:
 - [Market Share by Make](http://www.edmunds.com/industry-center/data/market-share-by-make.html) (data useage pending approval by the Edmunds team)

Without further ado, let's take a look at some analysis of the data!

###Tickets by Model Year

The below figure depicts the number of tickets assigned to cars manufactured in various years. We show that there is a steep increase in ticketing in cars manufactured after the 1990s, followed by a sharp decrease in the year 2008 (as highlighted by the red dotted line). This may be a result of the United States financial crisis, and resultant failure/bailout of the American automotive industry. Newer cars are likely to be less common on the roads, and therefore receive fewer overall tickets.

###Tickets by Automotive Make

The below charts illustrate the number of tickets and ticket rate by automotive make respectively. The left-hand plot shows the raw number of tickets given per vehicle make, while the right-hand plot attempts to normalize these values by dividing the number of tickets by the vehicle make's market share (as determined by the edmunds.com team) and transforming the values of the top 20 manufacturers to lie on a 0 to 1 scale.

###Top Ticketers

This plots shows the volume of tickets provided by various officers. The plot highlights the fact that only a small proportion of the officers who have registered citations in the system are responsible for the majority of the tickets.
